This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based
distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world environment.

Our goals are threefold:

- Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to
  demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.
- Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and
  demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.
- Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new
  versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.

We've already made [huge
progress](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md),
and development is ongoing. We hope to represent the full feature set of
OpenTelemetry across its languages in the future.

If you'd like to help (**which we would love**), check out our [contributing
guidance](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you'd like to extend this demo or maintain a fork of it, read our
[fork guidance](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/forking/).

## Quick start

You can be up and running with the demo in a few minutes. Check out the docs for
your preferred deployment method:

- [Docker](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/docker_deployment/)
- [Kubernetes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/kubernetes_deployment/)

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see [Demo Documentation][docs]. If you're curious
about a specific feature, the [docs landing page][docs] can point you in the
right direction.

## Demos featuring the Astronomy Shop

We welcome any vendor to fork the project to demonstrate their services and
